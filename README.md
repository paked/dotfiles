# paked's dotfiles!
These are a collection of my dotfiles!
Included are:
* vim
* zsh
* X
* i3
* termite
* tmux

## Installation
The install.py script is used for installation. Two options are available: permanent mode (-p), and a list of the wanted programs (-u). Permanent mode needs to be set to anything (it doesn't matter as long as it is set!) otherwise the script will install the desired programs into a testing directory (./test). The `-u` flag is for setting which programs you want to install, specifying none will install them all.
