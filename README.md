# paked's dotfiles!

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:paked/dotfiles
```

These are my dotfiles for i3, tmux and vim.

Previously I used a python script in order to install them, now I recommend that the person on the other end of this (probably me) manually links them.

```
ln -s ... ...
```

## Other things that need to be installed:

- Terminator (a terminal for i3)
- dmenu improved (a better dmenu for i3)
- A FontAwesome ttf (icons for i3status)
